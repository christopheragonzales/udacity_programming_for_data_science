00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:09,619
Python also has a useful way to assign multiple variables at once.

2
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:13,009
These three assignments can be abbreviated using

3
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:17,814
multiple assignments like this: x is still assigned to two,

4
00:00:17,815 --> 00:00:21,635
y to three, and z to five.

5
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:25,510
You can use this when you're assigning closely related variables like

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:30,495
the width and height of an object or an object coordinates.

7
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:32,899
In this example, we used x,

8
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,494
y, and z as variable names.

9
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:39,409
However, normally, we'd want something more descriptive.

10
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:41,329
x, y, and z would be

11
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:46,155
appropriate variable names for something like coordinates in a 3D space.

12
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:49,539
But for most other situations, we can do better.

13
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:53,490
For example, if you were computing the population density of

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,140
Mountain View by dividing the population by the land area,

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,335
this is one way to compute the correct answer.

16
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:05,010
But it's much clear with these variable names,

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,734
which are actually descriptive of the values they represent.

18
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:10,939
In addition to being descriptive,

19
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:15,444
there are a few things to watch out for when naming variables in Python.

20
00:01:15,444 --> 00:01:19,034
First, only use ordinary letters,

21
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:22,229
numbers, or underscores in your variable names.

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,734
They can't have spaces and need to start with a letter or underscore.

23
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:30,480
Second, you can't use reserved words or

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,275
built-in identifiers that have important purposes in Python,

25
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:37,560
which you'll learn about throughout this course.

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,010
There are also links below. Using them as variable names will lead to

27
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,950
errors or problematic situations when you try to use that word for its intended purpose.

28
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,760
Third, the pythonic way to name variables is to

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,359
use all lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.
