1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,283
Welcome to this lesson on data types and operators.

2
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:07,410
This is a very important lesson because it's where you'll learn about

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,445
the building blocks of Python datatypes and operators.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,880
Students tend to learn how to program at different rates.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,609
Take your time understanding each of the concepts that

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,285
follow and getting practice with activities in this lesson.

7
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:25,740
Having a firm grasp on these building blocks will provide a strong foundation

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,464
for future lessons and essential skills to continue programming beyond this course.

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,979
Throughout this course, we'll go through code examples using these boxes.

10
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,064
This first box represents the Code Editor which is where we will input our Python code,

11
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:41,849
and the second box represents

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,045
the output window which is where our results will be displayed.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,910
You can follow along with the video examples in

14
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,974
the classroom by typing in the code editor below each video.

15
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:58,230
Click the Test Run button to run your code and view the results in the output window.

16
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,079
You'll be seeing this print function pretty often.

17
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,824
It helps us see what's going on in our code.

18
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:08,335
For example, let's say you wanted to compute three plus five.

19
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,519
If we run this line of code,

20
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,789
Python would still add three and five but we wouldn't see

21
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,734
the result because we didn't tell Python to do anything with it.

22
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:24,432
Print is a useful built-in function in Python that we can use to display our results.

23
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:27,080
All we have to do is type in Print followed by

24
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,679
parentheses around whatever we want printed.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,835
You will be using Print often as you get to know the building blocks of Python,

26
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,849
its data types and operators.
