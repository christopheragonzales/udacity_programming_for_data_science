00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
Welcome to this lesson on data structures.

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,460
So far, you've dealt with variables representing individual basic data types,

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,460
like integers, floats, Booleans, and strings.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,330
In this lesson, you'll learn how to group and

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,225
order these data types into different data structures,

6
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:22,010
namely: lists, tuples, sets,

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,515
dictionaries, and compound data structures.

8
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:27,179
You'll also learn about the last two types of

9
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,963
operators in Python: membership and identity,

10
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:35,679
along with more built-in functions and methods. Let's get started.
