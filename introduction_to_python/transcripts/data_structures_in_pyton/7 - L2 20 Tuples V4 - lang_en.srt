00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:07,084
Python provides another useful container, tuples.

2
00:00:07,084 --> 00:00:11,359
Tuples are used to store related pieces of information.

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,954
A tuple is a data structure in Python that is an immutable ordered sequence of elements.

4
00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:22,389
Consider this example involving latitude and longitude.

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,710
Tuples are similar to lists in that they store

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,219
an ordered collection of objects which can be accessed by their indices.

7
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:34,405
For example, location zero and location one.

8
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:38,454
Unlike lists, however, tuples are immutable.

9
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:43,530
You cannot add or remove items from tuples or sort them in place.

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,905
Why do we have tuples if they're lists with fewer features?

11
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:52,310
Tuples are useful when you have two or more values that are so closely

12
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:58,070
related that they will always be used together like latitude and longitude coordinates.

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,649
Tuples can also be used to assign multiple variables in a compact way.

14
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:06,984
Notice that the values assigned to the tuple dimensions

15
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,885
aren't surrounded with parentheses as previous examples were.

16
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:14,510
The parentheses are optional when making tuples and

17
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,075
programmers frequently omit them if parentheses don't clarify the code.

18
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:20,719
In the second line,

19
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,644
three variables are assigned from the content of the tuple dimensions.

20
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:27,363
This is called tuple unpacking.

21
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:31,700
You can use tuple unpacking to assign the information from a tuple

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,439
into multiple variables without having to access them one by one,

23
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,875
and make multiple assignment statements.

24
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:43,629
In this example, if we won't need to use dimensions directly,

25
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:46,250
we could shorten those two lines of code into

26
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,420
a single line that assigns three variables in one go.
