00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,155
Let's introduce a new string method that works with lists, join().

2
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:11,324
Join takes a list as an argument and returns a string

3
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:15,199
consisting of the list elements joined by separator string.

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,515
In this example, we use a string,

5
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:20,085
backslash and as a separator,

6
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:24,010
so that there's a new line between each element, fore,

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,605
new line, aft, new line,

8
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:29,185
starboard, new line, port.

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,884
We can also use other strings as separators with join.

10
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:35,054
Here, we use a hyphen.

11
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:37,859
It's important to remember to separate each of

12
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:41,000
the items in the list you're joining with a comma.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,984
Forgetting to do so will not trigger an error,

14
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:46,719
but will also give you unexpected results.

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,574
In the example below,

16
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:53,540
omitting a comma between Garcia and O'Kelley results in the following;

17
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:58,740
Notice how the hyphen separator is missing between Garcia and O'Kelley,

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,655
and instead, the two strings were appended.

19
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:06,454
This happens because of Python's default string literal appending.

20
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:09,795
If join returns different results than expected,

21
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,900
check for missing commas.

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,295
Also, note that join will trigger an error,

23
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:18,144
if we tried to join anything other than strings.

24
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:23,004
We get an error here because an integer was included in the lists.

25
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:26,280
Lastly, a helpful method called append,

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,745
adds an element to the end of the lists.

27
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:33,520
Next, you'll practice working with lists and explore more list methods.
