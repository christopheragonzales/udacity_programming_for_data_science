1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,970
So, how are lists different from strings?

2
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:08,279
You saw that both support indexing,

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:10,704
slicing, and the in operator.

4
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:15,175
The most obvious difference is that strings are sequences of letters,

5
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:18,580
while list elements can be any type of object.

6
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:24,344
Or more subtle difference is that lists can be modified but strings can't.

7
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:31,199
Here, we can change the fourth element index three of this list to Friday, if you want.

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,339
But here, we get an error if we tried to change the third element of a string.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,170
The technical term for whether an object can be

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,010
modified after its creation is mutability.

11
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,625
We can modify the values of lists.

12
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,140
So, a list is an mutable data type.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,399
We can't modify strings,

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,454
so a string is an immutable data type.

15
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:56,238
As we introduce more data types,

16
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,324
there are two factors that we will continue to consider.

17
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:03,585
One is mutability, and the other is order.

18
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:08,204
Order is whether the order of contents for an object matters,

19
00:01:08,204 --> 00:01:13,069
and whether or not, part of the object can be accessed using this order.

20
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:16,189
Both strings and lists are ordered,

21
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,944
which is why indexing works well for them.

22
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:23,000
However, one is mutable while the other is not.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,519
We will see more data types that fall under

24
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,685
different sections of this grid as we continue.

25
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:33,890
For now, we'll explore the methods and functions that work on lists,

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,719
and we'll take advantage of list mutability in our programs.
